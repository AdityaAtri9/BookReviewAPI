# BookReviewAPI

A simple RESTful API for managing books and their reviews using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- `models/` â€“ Mongoose schemas for Books and Reviews
- `routes/` â€“ API route handlers
- `middleware/` â€“ Authentication middleware (JWT-based)
- `app.js` â€“ Entry point
- `.env` â€“ Environment variables (not committed)
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview
- `schema.md` â€“ Database schema

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

cd BookReviewAPI
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root with the following content:

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Run the Project Locally

```
npm start
```

## ðŸ“¬ API Endpoints

### Books

- `POST /books` â€“ Add a book (auth required)
- `GET /books` â€“ List all books with pagination  
  - Query Parameters:
    - `page` (optional, default: 1)
    - `limit` (optional, default: 10)

## ðŸ§  Assumptions / Design Decisions

- JWT-based authentication is used.
- MongoDB Atlas is used for scalable cloud storage.
- User info is inferred from `req.userId` after JWT middleware.
- Searching is partial and case-insensitive.

## ðŸ›  Tools

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose
- Postman (used for testing)
